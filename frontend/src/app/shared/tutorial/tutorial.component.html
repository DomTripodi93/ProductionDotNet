<h2 class="centered">Lets Get Started!</h2>
<br>
<h4 *ngIf="!lathes" class="centered">
  Start by adding your first <a routerLink="/lathe/machine/new">Lathe</a>. It's not 
  going to give you any options for the job or op field, but that is perfectly 
  normal, it can be added with only a name. 
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="!lathes" class="centered">
  You will also need to have at least 1 <a routerLink="/lathe/parts/new">Lathe Part</a> to be able to add a 
  <a routerLink="/lathe/jobs/new">Lathe Job</a>, with a <a routerLink="/lathe/jobs">Lathe Operation</a>.
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="lathes && !latheParts" class="centered">
  Now that you have added a machine, lets add your first part! 
  A <a routerLink="/lathe/parts/new">Part</a> needs to have a "part number", and a revision level. 
  Parts cannot be changed once they are created, they can only be deleted and re-input, 
  or added again with a different revision level. This is intentional to maintain consistancy of 
  which revision of a part was made in a specific job, to collect accurate production information.
  The same <a routerLink="/lathe/parts/new">Lathe Part</a> can be used on as many jobs as you need it for.
  <br>
  You will need to have at least 1 <a routerLink="/lathe/parts/new">Part</a> to be able to add a 
  <a routerLink="/lathe/jobs/new">Lathe Job</a>
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="latheParts && !latheJobs" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first part, we can add our first <a routerLink="/lathe/jobs/new">Lathe Job</a>. 
  <br>
  A lathe job can hold information for the size of a part and material recieved for the job, so that maximum yield
  can be calculated. 
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="latheJobs && !latheOps" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first job, you will be able to use the production
  calculator features for that job. 
  <br>
  Now lets add an <a routerLink="/lathe/jobs">Lathe Operation</a> to the job below by clicking the "Add New Operation" button. 
  <br>
  Once you have a job and operation, you can assign them to your machine which 
  will allow you to create production lots, and input hourly production. 
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="latheOps && !hourly" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first job and operation, you can assign a job and operation to your lathe.
  <br>
  After your lathe can a current job and op, you will be able to create production lots,
  and hourly production inputs.
  <br>
  From the <a routerLink="/lathe/machine">Lathes</a> page, or the <a routerLink="/hourly">Hourly Tracking</a> page
  you will be able to asign a job and op to your lathe if you have not already done so. 
  <br>
  Once a job is assigned, you can add an hourly production count by clicking on 
  "<strong>Quick Input</strong>." from the <a routerLink="/hourly">Hourly Tracking</a> page.
  <br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="hourly && !latheProduction" class="centered">
  Now that we have our first hourly production count, lets try adding a 
  <a routerLink="/lathe/production/new">Lathe Production Lot</a>. Your production lots will be used to track 
  how many parts have been made to an operation on the job so far. 
  <br>
  The production lot will be attributed to the current job and op of the selected machine on the production 
  creation form.
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="latheProduction" class="centered">
  After adding <a routerLink="/lathe/production/new">Multiple Lathe Production Lots</a> for one job, the 
  <a routerLink="/lathe/production/op={{op}}&job={{latheJob}}">Lathe Production By Job and Op</a> page will show total parts 
  to date for the operation. This can also be reached by using the dropdown on the 
  <a routerLink="/lathe/production">Lathe Production</a> page, and checking the production for the current
  job and operation on the selected lathe.
