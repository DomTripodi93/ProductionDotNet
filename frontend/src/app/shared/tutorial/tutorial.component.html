<h2 class="centered">Lets Get Started!</h2>

<h4 *ngIf="!machines" class="centered">
  Start by adding a <a routerLink="/machine/new">Machine</a>. It's not 
  going to give you any options for the job or op field, but that is perfectly 
  normal. 
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="!machines" class="centered">
  You will need to have at least 1 <a routerLink="/machine/new">Machine</a> and 1 <a routerLink="/parts/new">Part</a> to be able to add a 
  <a routerLink="/jobs/new">Job</a>, and at least 1 <a routerLink="/jobs/new">Job</a> to assign an <a routerLink="/jobs">Op</a> to.
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="machines && !parts" class="centered">
  Now that you have created a machine, lets add your first part! 
  A <a routerLink="/parts/new">Part</a> only needs to have a "part number." 
  The same <a routerLink="/parts/new">Part</a> can be used on as many jobs as you need it for.
  <br>
  You will need to have at least 1 <a routerLink="/parts/new">Part</a> to be able to add a 
  <a routerLink="/jobs/new">Job</a>
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="parts && !jobs" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first part, we can add our first <a routerLink="/jobs/new">Job</a>. A job 
  holds all of your information for the material recieved for the job. 
  <br> 
  By inputing information for the first lathe operation, you will be able to calculate a maximum production 
  for the material recieved.
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="jobs && !ops" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first job, you will be able to use the production
  calculator features for that job. 
  <br>
  Now lets add an <a routerLink="/jobs">Operation</a> to the job below, which will let us create production lots 
  and hourly production, after we assign a job and op to our machine. 
<br>
</h4>
<h4  *ngIf="ops && !hourly" class="centered">
  Now that you have created your first job and operation, you will be able to use the production 
  tracking features for that job.
  <br>
  Lets start by using the <a routerLink="/hourly">Hourly Tracking</a> where you will see a button that allows 
  you to asign a job and op to your machine if you have not already done so. Once a job is assigned, you can add a 
  production count by clicking on "<strong>quick input</strong>."
  <br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="hourly && !production" class="centered">
  Now that we have our first hourly production count, lets try adding a 
  <a routerLink="/production/new">Production Lot</a>. Your production lots will be used to track 
  how many parts have been made to an operation on the job so far.
<br>
</h4>
<h4 *ngIf="production" class="centered">
  After adding <a routerLink="/production/new">Multiple Production Lots</a> for one job, the 
  <a routerLink="/production/op={{op}}&job={{job}}">Production By Job and Op</a> page will show total parts 
  to date for the operation. This can also be reached by using the dropdown on the 
  <a routerLink="/production">Production</a> page, and checking the production for the current
  job and operation on the selected machine.
