My Production Status

A web application for managing CNC Manufacturing Production.

Why
- To provide clean, clear, and historical production tracking, status, and expected production levels for high production Manufacturers who use CNC Lathes and Mills to make parts for industries such as medical or aerospace.
- To streamline expected steps of mathmatical analysis that are repeatedly used to manage production.

What
- A Lathe Production suite that tracks production per operation for multiple jobs, that run different parts on multiple machines.
- Hourly Tracking for current production per operation on multiple lathes 
- A Mill Production suite for tracking current totals in all operations for multiple jobs, that run different parts on multiple machines.
